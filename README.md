Final Project

Our final project is the recreation of some classic games that we all grew up with. The first (within the Final_Proj folder) is a space shooter where you control the player ship at the bottom with the left/right arrow keys and shoot with the spacebar. The second game that we recreated, found within Tower Defense, is a tower defense game.
